1. Initial Recipe Data Array

let recipes = [
  {
    id: uuidv4(),
    title: "Chicken Biryani",
    ingredients: "Basmati rice, chicken, yogurt, onions, spices, saffron",
    instructions: "Marinate chicken, cook rice separately, layer and cook together",
    cookingTime: "60 minutes",
    category: "Main Course"
  },
  {
    id: uuidv4(),
    title: "Chocolate Cake",
    ingredients: "Flour, cocoa powder, sugar, eggs, butter, milk",
    instructions: "Mix dry ingredients, add wet ingredients, bake at 350Â°F",
    cookingTime: "45 minutes",
    category: "Dessert"
  },
  {
    id: uuidv4(),
    title: "Caesar Salad",
    ingredients: "Lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, caesar dressing",
    instructions: "Chop lettuce, add toppings, toss with dressing",
    cookingTime: "10 minutes",
    category: "Salad"
  }
];

2. Routes You Need to Build

GET /recipes           - Show all recipes (index page)
GET /recipes/new       - Show form to add new recipe
POST /recipes          - Create new recipe
GET /recipes/:id       - Show single recipe details
GET /recipes/:id/edit  - Show edit form for recipe
PATCH /recipes/:id     - Update existing recipe
DELETE /recipes/:id    - Delete recipe

3. Step-by-Step Building Process
Step 1: Basic Setup

Copy your express setup from the Quora project
Change the array from posts to recipes
Update the port message to mention "Recipe Book"

Step 2: Index Route (Show All Recipes)

Create GET /recipes route
Make it render an index.ejs file
Pass the recipes array to the template

Questions for you to think about:

How did you pass the posts array in your Quora project?
What should you change in the render statement?

Step 3: Create the Index View

Create views/index.ejs
Display all recipes in a nice format
Show: title, cooking time, category
Add buttons for "View Details", "Edit", "Delete" for each recipe
Add a "Add New Recipe" button

Challenge: How will you loop through the recipes in EJS?
Step 4: New Recipe Route & Form

Create GET /recipes/new route
Create views/new.ejs with a form
Form fields: title, ingredients, instructions, cookingTime, category

Think about:

What method should the form use?
Where should it submit to?

Step 5: Create Recipe (POST)

Create POST /recipes route
Extract data from req.body
Generate new ID with uuidv4()
Push to recipes array
Redirect to recipes list

Questions:

How did you do this in your Quora project?
What needs to change for recipe data?
